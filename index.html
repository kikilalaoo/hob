        <h3> READING!!!ðŸ˜€</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
    <p id="para">Reading is the #1 of the many things I love to do. During this summer reading was the thign that made summer exiting. I loved deafting Lord Voldemort with Harry potter and swimming by the side for the semi-mermaid, Emily Windsnap. Every free time I have, I pull out a book and devour it. I am book monster and books are always on my menu! </p>

    <p id="para"> I have read so many books since I was a little kindergartener to where I am now. (About to start middle school next year.) But, there are some book that I will love the most. One of the is the Harry Potter. The book was so intriguing, that I felt so sad when I finished because there was no more books in that series.</p>
